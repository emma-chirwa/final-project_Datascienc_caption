    "International migration involves people crossing state boundaries and staying in the host state for a minimum length of time. Migration occurs for many reasons. The overwhelming majority of people migrate internationally for reasons related to work, family and study. In contrast, other people leave their homes and countries for a range of compelling and sometimes tragic reasons, such as conflict, persecution and disaster. While those who have been displaced, such as refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), comprise a relatively small percentage of all migrants, they are often the most in need of assistance and support. International migration is the process of moving from one country to another.\n",
    ". Therefore, it is advantageous for countries to accurately predict how many International migration may have and compare the current number and the likely number to have in the future.\n"
